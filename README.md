# Advanced-Building-Blocks---Enumerables
By Carlos Robles & John Durán.

This project was built with Ruby.
We created Enumerable class method.
And we work on how to create methods inside classes.

This is the list of the methods that we created:

```
my_each
my_each_with_index
my_select
my_all?
my_any?
my_none?
my_count
my_map
my_inject
multiply_els
```

## Running tests with Rspec

This game was tested with Rspec wich is a computer domain-specific language (DSL) testing tool written in programming language Ruby to test Ruby code. It is a behavior-driven development (BDD) framework which is extensively used in production applications.

## How to get Rspec running

- In the terminal, type `gem install rspec`
- Once done, go to project directory and type `rspec --init`
- You will see a folder `spec` and a file `.rspec`
- Inside spec folder you'll see a `spec_helper.rb` file.
- In the terminal, type `rspec`
